1.The ordinary or partial differential equation we need to solve along with the boundary/Initial conditions are incorporated into the loss function of the neural network.

This for the simple y' + y(x) = 0 for $$y(x) = e^{-x}$$ to explain the basics of custom neural networking models are being implemented using tensorflow.keras in the program.
Goal is to be able to scale this program to any O.D.E.

Line 19: class ODE_1st(tf.keras.Model):
Here the class ODE_1st we are defining is employing the inheritance property where it is inheriting the abilities of the pre-defined tf.keras.Model class through which you can create your own custom neural network (can decide how many
